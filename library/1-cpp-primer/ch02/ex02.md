I'd use `double` instead of `float`, because accuracy in calculations is more depended that speed

And also speed of computation is not so dramatically decrease (in any cases it can be increased)

But that floating point types is not absolute accurate, better use analog of `decimal` from C#.
My final answer is: I'd rather to use `libgmp` `decimal` types that standard C++ floating point numbers

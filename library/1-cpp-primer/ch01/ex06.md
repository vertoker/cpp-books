Here's the code

```
std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
          << " and " << v2;
          << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
```

It's incorrect, because lines 1 and 2 on the end has `;`, 
therefore lines 2 and 3 doesn't have `std::cout`, 
therefore that program can't compile

Solution: delete `;` on end of lines 1 and 2

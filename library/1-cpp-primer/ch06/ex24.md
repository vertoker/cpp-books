Here's wrong function

```cpp
void print(const int ia[10])
{
    for (size_t i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
        std::cout << ia[i] << std::endl;
}
```

In parameters already defined size of array, better use it and don't use equals constants, defined in different places
For that mechanic, exists auto for with range counting, also named as `foreach`

```cpp
void print(const int ia[10])
{
    for (const auto& i : ia)
        std::cout << i << std::endl;
}
```

If this condition `if (val != 0)` is stopping condition, then it will be correctly

- factorial(3) - return factorial(3-1) * 3;
- factorial(2) - return factorial(2-1) * 2;
- factorial(1) - return factorial(1-1) * 1;
- factorial(0) - return 1;

But such efficient like `if (val > 1)` condition, because of twice mult by 1 in any case

But this will works only for positive and 0, in negative it will never stops recursive call

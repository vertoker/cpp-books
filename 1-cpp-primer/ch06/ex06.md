Parameter - variable in "header" of function, can be defined on function call, exists only in current call lifecycle

Local variable - variable, that only exists in current function call, any parameter is local variable

Local static variable - local variable, which breaks lifecycle rule and creates before function call.
It behaves like global variable (in lifecycle aspect) (creates on program start and destroy on program end), 
but still can be used only inside function (like local variable)

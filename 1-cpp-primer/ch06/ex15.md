here's next signature of the function

```cpp
std::string::size_type finc_char(const std::string& s, char c, std::string::size_type& occurs)
```

`s` is string with unlimited size, can't pass it as a value. In most situations, uses reference.
Also in most cases, string will be used only for read information, therefore here's stand `const` for type

`c` is a simple build-in type with small size, pass it as a value is better option

`occurs` is not a usual build-in parameter, it designed to store answer besides of main return

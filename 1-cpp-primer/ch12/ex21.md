First code

```cpp
std::string& deref() const {
    auto p = check(curr, "dereference past end");
    return (*p)[curr];
}
```

secode code

```cpp
std::string& deref() const
    { return (*check(curr, "dereference past end"))[curr]; }
```

First is better, because it's more readable and debuggable

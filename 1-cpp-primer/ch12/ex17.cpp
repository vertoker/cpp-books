// Exercise 12.17:
// Which of the following unique_ptr declarations are illegal or likely to
// result in subsequent program error? Explain what the problem is with each
// one.
//
// Exercise 12.18:
// Why doesnâ€™t shared_ptr have a release member?
//  Because other shared_ptr that points the same object can still delete this
//  object.Thus, it's meaningless to provide this member
//  more detail can be found a thread on Stack Overflow:

    // IntP p1(pi); // runtime error, on delete it try to delete stack variable ix, which is not possible (because it's not a heap)

    { IntP p2(pi2); } // runtime error, in scope everything is fine, but after - pi2 will be deleted 
                      // and cause dangling pointer, which allocated on a deleted heap memory
    
    // IntP p3(&ix); // runtime , variable ix allocated via stack, delete a stack memory is an error

    // IntP p4(new int(2048)); // legal, everything great

    // IntP p5(p2.get()); // runtime error, double free calls, which cause an error

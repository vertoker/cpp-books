Following code

```cpp
int *q = new int(42), *r = new int(100);
r = q;

auto q2 = make_shared<int>(42), r2 = make_shared<int>(100);
r2 = q2;
```

- for `r = q` cause 2 errors
    - pointers `r` and `q` is not deleted, they continue exists
    - pointer to allocated memory in variable `r` is losted after `r = q`
- for `r2 = q2` everything ok
    - they has auto destroy
    - after `r2 = q2`, previous `r2` data is auto deleted

I'm too lazy to write examples, I just explain why I'd rather to choose `while`

`while` is more simple and easy to read loop statement, while `for` is not.
`for` exists for index iteration, for increasing/decreasing current number

But most important, with `while` I can easy recreate logic for `for`, while with `for`
I need to write shit looks and not visual easy statement to recreate `while`

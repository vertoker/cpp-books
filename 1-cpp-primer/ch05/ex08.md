`dangling else is a wide problem for programming languages, this problem about this:

```cpp
if (a)
    if (b)
        c;
else
    d;
```

Which `if` have this `else`: `if (a)` or `if (b)`. C standard clarifies that an `else` associated
with nearest `if`. That means `if (b)` have that `else`

This problem is about confusing syntax, better way to fix it - add more blocks `{ }` for `if`'s

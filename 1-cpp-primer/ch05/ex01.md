Empty operator `;` means `null statement`, which can be useful in control-of-flow operators as `if` or `while`

As an example, operator `if` can't exist without body, which can be represented by block or single statement

And that single example can be that `null statement`. Just paste `;` after `()` brackets and it will be valid expression

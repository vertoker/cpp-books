Block is a local scope for isolation of commands from parented blocks/scopes

Block can be represented as body for control-of-flow operators like `if`, `while`, `for` and others

I'd use block when I need to write more than one expressions in body of any operator higher

Block can be empty, it valid not only in operators, but also in methods and classes

In binary search, for calculation `mid`, using custom `lerp` function.
It calculates by next formula:

`left(a, b, t) => a + (b - a) * t`

For that algorithm, `a` - means `begin`, `b` - means `end`, `t` - means `0.5` as half.
Therefore, algorithm for binary search will be next:

`mid = begin + (end - begin) * 0.5` or `mid = begin + (end - begin) / 2`

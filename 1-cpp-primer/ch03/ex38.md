You can calculate difference between pointer in numbers, but addition 2 pointers?

Pointer point to specific memory address globally in RAM, which means it 
can be as number is huge, like maybe `121544534` byte.
In example, there is another pointer, which point to the `143745343` byte

Addition means addition their bytes presentations, `121544534 + 143745343` 
will be address, that doesn't make sense in RAM, because it's not allocated and,
most frequently, will be point to the secure memory and it will cause memory leak
